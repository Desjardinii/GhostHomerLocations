# GhostHomer Custom Locations for DSR_Cherno
This plugin consists of GhostHomer's custom map locations for DSR_Cherno for Desolation:Redux
With his permission I have created zombie spawn points for them, and packed it into a plugin for easy updating.

Install Instructions:

1. Copy the GhostHomerLocations.cfg file from the \Config folder to the @DesolationServer\config\ folder.
2. Using notepad++ or a simlilar editor, edit the PluginList file and add in GhostHomerLocations to the list
3. Copy the GhostHomerLocations PBO from the \addons folder over to the @DesolationServer\addons\ folder. 
4. Start the server.  You should now have his custom locations added.
