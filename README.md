# GhostHomer Custom Locations for DSR_Cherno
This plugin consists of GhostHomer's custom map locations for DSR_Cherno for Desolation:Redux
With his permission I have created zombie spawn points for them, and packed it into a plugin for easy updating.

Install Instructions:

1. If it is not already, unpack your Desolation PBO from the @DesolationServer addon.
2. Copy the GhostHomerLocations.cfg file from the \Config folder to the @DesolationServer\config\ folder.
3. Using notepad++ or a simliar editor, edit the PluginList file and add in GhostHomerLocations to the list
4. Copy the GhostHomerLocations PBO from the \addons folder over to the @DesolationServer\addons\ folder. 
5. Start the server.  You should now have his custom locations added.
